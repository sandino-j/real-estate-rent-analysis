# 📜 What I Learned

In this project, I explored **rental property data in Brazil** using only **Pandas** for data analysis.  
During the development, I practiced and learned:

- How to **load local CSV files** using `pd.read_csv()`
- How to **view the first and last records** of a DataFrame with `.head()` and `.tail()`
- How to **check the data types and structure** of the DataFrame using `type()`, `.shape` and `.info()`
- How to **access specific columns** or multiple columns with `data['column']` and `data[['col1','col2']]`
- How to **calculate numeric averages** with `.mean()`
- How to **group data by category** using `.groupby()`
- How to **sort the results** with `.sort_values()`
- How to **generate simple charts directly from Pandas** to visualize comparisons

# 📊 What the Project Does

The goal of this project is to analyze the **average rental prices** of different **property types** (such as apartments, houses, etc.) in the dataset.  

The code groups the data by **Type**, calculates the **average rental value**, and displays the result in a **horizontal bar chart**, making it easy to visualize which categories have the highest and lowest prices.
